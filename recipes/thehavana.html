        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Don't use your dad's favorite cigars that he quietly stashes away in his “secret” hiding place. I do recommend that you use a good
          cigar though…you will taste it in the finished drink.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don't have to use his favorite bourbon when you make this either. You'll definitely be elevating the flavor of whatever
          bourbon you use. But don't some cheap nasty tasty bourbon…it won't elevate it that much.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're able, make a single large ice cube to add to the glass, it adds a touch of class to the drink and it melts much more
          slowly than a bunch of small cubes.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tobacco Infused Bourbon:</li>
          <li>1 Cup (.24l) Bourbon</li>
          <li>3 1" (2.54cm) Pieces Cut from a Good Quality Cigar</li>
          <li>Cocktail:</li>
          <li>2 Ounces (59ml) Infused Bourbon</li>
          <li>¾ Ounce (22ml) Frangelico</li>
          <li>12 Dashes Aztec Chocolate Bitters</li>
          <li>9 Dashes Cherry Bitters</li>
          <li>3 Dashes Angosturo Bitters</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Tobacco Infused Bourbon:</li>
          <li>Add cigar pieces to a re-sealable glass container.</li>
          <li>Pour bourbon over the top of the cigar pieces.</li>
          <li>Stir the bourbon and tobacco to loosen up the leaves and continue to stir until all of the leaves are separated.</li>
          <li>Seal the container and set in a cool place for 6 hours.</li>
          <li>After 6 hours, strain the bourbon through a fine mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth.</li>
          <li>Cocktail:</li>
          <li>Add the bourbon and Frangelico to a large rocks glass.</li>
          <li>Add in the various bitters and stir to combine all ingredients.</li>
          <li>Carefully place the ice into the glass and serve.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
          Before lining the sieve with the cheesecloth, dampen it with water first (squeeze out the excess water first). By wetting the
          cheesecloth first, you'll keep the cheesecloth from absorbing your bourbon. You will have enough tobacco infused bourbon to make 4
          drinks.

        <h1>Cigar Pairing</h1>
        <p>
          My Father is a wonderful cigar created by Jaime Garcia in dedication to his father, Jose “Pepin” Garcia. Handcrafted in Estelí,
          Nicaragua, My Father showcases a glorious Ecuador Habano wrapper and lovely blend of aged Nicaraguan tobaccos. Full-bodied in
          strength, these cigars offer an earthy core of flavor around which an enticing web of sweet cedar and nuts is spun. A peppery
          spice permeates every inch of this cigar and leaves your mouth watering when you finally nub it.
