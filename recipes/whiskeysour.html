      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The key to an excellent whiskey sour? Getting the balance just right. This whiskey sour recipe has all the right proportions of
        bright, bracing lemon juice; warming, floral bourbon; and sweet simple syrup to deliver a refreshing cocktail that's neither too
        cloying nor too biting. Using freshly squeezed juice is essentialâ€”the stuff that comes out of fruit-shaped squeeze bottles doesn't
        even compare. If you don't have any lemon on hand, you can swap it out for lime (or a mixture of the two). Serve on the rocks with
        an orange wheel and a Maraschino cherry arranged neatly on a drink spear (optional but recommended!), and enjoy. Cheers!
