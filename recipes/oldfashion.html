        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          When you get right down to it, the Bourbon Old Fashioned is little more than a slug of whiskey, seasoned and sweetened. Yet for
          all of its suave simplicity, the drink remains as relevant today as it was when it first captured drinkers hearts 200 years ago.
